# Magnet Stamps!

I recently received a fridge magnet from my college, to whom I have zero intention of ever donating to. Instead of throwing it away, I cut it up and added some 3d-printed backs to make stamps of various shapes for my son to use with his magnet drawing boards.

This repo has both the STLs as well as some of the files that went into creating them, namely the SVGs for each shape, the OpenSCAD file that imported them, and the shell script that I used to batch-export the STLs.
